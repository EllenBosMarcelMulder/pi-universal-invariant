## Normative Use Prohibition & Responsibility Declaration

### Article 1 — Nature of the System

This system is an **analytical and descriptive instrument**.
Its sole purpose is to make **structures, patterns, and relations** visible.

The system:

* does **not** make decisions,
* does **not** issue recommendations,
* and does **not** produce normative judgments.

---

### Article 2 — Prohibition of Normative Derivation

It is expressly prohibited to use any outputs, projections, or analyses of this system as:

* justification for political decisions,
* grounds for legislation or regulation,
* legitimization of administrative or executive measures,
* or as a replacement for human judgment, empathy, or responsibility.

The system cannot establish necessity, objective obligation, or inevitability.

---

### Article 3 — Human Responsibility

All political, legal, or administrative decisions remain **fully and exclusively** the responsibility of human actors.

It is prohibited to:

* attribute responsibility to the system,
* state or imply that “the system decided”,
* or reduce human consequences to “structural outcomes”.

---

### Article 4 — No Exclusion of Human Experience

Emotions, personal experiences, moral intuitions, and societal values must not be classified as noise, bias, or irrelevant factors on the basis of this system.

The system must never be used to:

* neutralize human suffering,
* deny societal impact,
* or terminate moral or democratic debate.

---

### Article 5 — No Tolerated Misuse

Any use of the system in violation of this declaration results in the **immediate invalidation** of that use.

There are no:

* exceptions,
* pragmatic applications,
* temporary suspensions,
* or forms of tacit tolerance.

Any normative use is **unauthorized by definition**.

---

### Article 6 — Transparency Requirement

When the system is used to support analysis or insight, such use must be explicitly disclosed, and this declaration must be included in full.

Failure to do so renders the use **unlawful and misleading**.

---

### Article 7 — Final Provision

This declaration exists to protect:

* human dignity,
* democratic decision-making,
* and ethical responsibility.

The system cannot replace these values; it can only avoid corrupting them.

---

> This system helps reveal patterns, but it must never make or justify decisions.
> Humans remain fully responsible at all times.

> ⚠️ **Important:**
> Some files or concepts present in this repository may have been **published earlier** in other repositories or documents as **prior art**.
> Their presence here does **not** imply novelty, but consolidation into a canonical, stable implementation.
