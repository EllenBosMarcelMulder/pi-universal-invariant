# π as a Universal Geometric Invariant  
### Pre-announcement – Physics of Nature & University of Ohrid

## Abstract  
The mathematical constant π = 3.14159… has traditionally entered geometry through circle definitions, appearing axiomatically in circumference and area formulas. Here we demonstrate that π manifests consistently across independent mathematical constructions—from spherical coordinate integration to Fourier analysis, probability theory, and complex analysis. While spherical parametrization reveals geometric consistency, the ubiquitous appearance of π across domains suggests its role as a universal geometric invariant rather than an arbitrary constant. Through systematic analysis of π's manifestation in Buffon’s needle problems, number theory, and harmonic analysis, we establish π as encoding fundamental rotational symmetries that transcend specific geometric contexts. This universality repositions π from a circle-specific ratio to a mathematical constant reflecting deeper structural principles of coherent space.
